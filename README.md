## ðŸ”¬ Comparative Analysis of STDP Rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)

This repository provides a unified experimental framework to implement and compare various Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under identical conditions. The goal is to explore how different biologically inspired plasticity mechanisms affect learning performance and computational efficiency in neuromorphic systems.



## ðŸ§  Background

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically plausible and energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), using discrete spikes and time-dependent learning rules like STDP. However, most prior work focuses on a single STDP rule. This project aims to systematically compare multiple STDP rulesâ€”both computationally and biologicallyâ€”under consistent experimental conditions.



## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

By emulating biologically realistic synaptic plasticity, this work investigates whether integrating neurological principles into AI models can yield interpretable and efficient learning. We evaluate multiple STDP rules across benchmarks to assess their performance, biological plausibility, and potential applications in neuromorphic learning.
